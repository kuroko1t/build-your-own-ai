```

## Quality Guidelines

Before submitting a tutorial, please ensure it meets these criteria:

- **Build from scratch** — The tutorial should guide the reader through building something, not just using a library or API
- **Complete** — The tutorial should be reasonably complete, not just a code snippet
- **Educational** — The tutorial should explain concepts, not just provide code
- **Working** — The code/tutorial should be functional and up-to-date
- **Free** — The tutorial should be freely accessible (no paywall)

## Rules

- Add new entries at the **end** of the relevant category
- One tutorial per Pull Request (preferred, but not required)
- Check that your link is not already listed
- Do not add promotional content or low-quality tutorials
- Tutorials in any programming language are welcome
- Both written tutorials and video tutorials are accepted
